**The code is in JavaScript,HTML and php.**

**Google APIs   and   Indian Railways APIs(from third party) have been used with unique keys for a particular user.**

in to ones           for trains b/w two points:

**Then from run->optionalfeatures.exe->exapand internet information services(do not tick the box)->expand world wide web services-> make sure CGI is checked**

I was provided with JQUERY 2.1.4.min

I contacted the admin of the third party providing railway API through an enquiry form service because of the JSON response problem, the response had to be converted to JSONp and hence, the curl method was used.

I also had taken help from faculty members from the CSIT department, the curl method was suggested by them.

I am not putting out the API keys because of privacy issues. If required I can mail them for rechecking purpose. 

**I have also uploaded the TRAIN_ROUTE file which was a failed attempt, but for the purpose of transperancy I am uploading it, it was also produced to the HOD while submission and demonstration.**
