The above url was used to download the nts version of php.

 (This is the first one in the directory from which it can be downloded)
 
**Then from run->optionalfeatures.exe->exapand internet information services(do not tick the box)->expand world wide web services-> make sure CGI is checked**

I was provided with JQUERY 2.1.4.min

I contacted the admin of the third party providing railway API through an enquiry form service because of the JSON response problem, the response had to be converted to JSONp and hence, the curl method was used.

I also had taken help from faculty members from the CSIT department, the curl method was suggested by them.

I am not putting out the API keys because of privacy issues. If required I can mail them for rechecking purpose. 

**I have also uploaded the TRAIN_ROUTE file which was a failed attempt, but for the purpose of transperancy I am uploading it, it was also produced to the HOD while submission and demonstration.** 


The files if downloaded onto you another system won't work if softwares are not properly installed.

**the files are saved on my System C drive->inetpub->wwwroot**
**to view on browser http://localhost/maproute.html**
maproute file is linked to the train.html file(train list) through html iframe tag**
